# PasteAndGo 2 Changelog

### 1.1


### 1.0
**Initial Release**
PasteAndGo 2 (1.0) is available for free on the Twickd repository.
This tweak is based on u/apieceoflint's PasteAndGo tweak, so please go support him as well. ;)
It aims to add some cool features to the original one, such as:
Support for more web browsers, such as Firefox, Firefox Focus, Google Chrome, and more!
Support for more languages such as Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and more that I will be adding!
If the text on the clipboard is not an URL but just a normal word, search it with Google (though Iâ€™m working to make it search with the preferred search engine).
This is my first tweak ever, and any advice is welcome. Suggestions are also appreciated!
The tweak is obviously free, and open-source. Thank you and hope you have a nice day!
