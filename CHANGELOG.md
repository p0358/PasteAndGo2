# PasteAndGo 2 Changelog

### 1.1
**Second release: rewrite**
ðŸ¥³ Ibiza v1.0 is **now available for free** on Dynastic!
Ibiza is a powerful multitasking tweak for the clipboard that adds several options to the menu that appears when you force-touch many apps. It includes many features, such as:
- Directly search the word or go to the link copied on your clipboard with several web browsers.
- Compose a post with the contents copied on your clipboard in Reddit and Apollo.
- Compose a tweet or search for a user with the contents in your clipboard.
- Add the sources on your clipboard to Sileo, Cydia, and Zebra.
- Compose emails with the contents of your clipboard.
- Search for an app on the App Store with the contents of your clipboard.

#### Wait, isn't this just an improved version of PasteAndGo 2?
Yes, since I was adding more features and moving it from Twickd to Dynastic, and there were some issues with the tweak itself (such as the code being messy), I decided to rewrite it, rename it, and release it as a whole new tweak.
This release fixes most of the reported bugs on PasteAndGo 2, including:
- Option not appearing on iOS 12 and 11.
- Links not opening on Safari.



#### Why Ibiza?
I decided to name all my future tweaks after some Mediterranean Islands.
For those who don't know, Ibiza is a Spanish island located in the Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of Spain.  It is the third-largest island of the Balearic Islands, and its largest settlements are Ibiza Town, Santa EulÃ ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany.

####Â Known Issues
**1. Partial support for iOS 11 and 12.**
I've been reported that there are some cases where Ibiza doesn't detect apps correctly or just doesn't work at all on devices running iOS versions lower than 12.


To keep track of all the bugs you can check the issues page on the GitHub repo.
More coming soon, get Ibiza for free now on the Dynastic Repo!
Huge thanks to u/tychoregter for suggesting this.


### 1.0
**Initial Release**
PasteAndGo 2 (1.0) is available for free on the Twickd repository.
This tweak is based on u/apieceoflint's PasteAndGo tweak, so please go support him as well. ;)
It aims to add some cool features to the original one, such as:
Support for more web browsers, such as Firefox, Firefox Focus, Google Chrome, and more!
Support for more languages such as Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and more that I will be adding!
If the text on the clipboard is not an URL but just a normal word, search it with Google (though Iâ€™m working to make it search with the preferred search engine).
This is my first tweak ever, and any advice is welcome. Suggestions are also appreciated!
The tweak is obviously free, and open-source. Thank you and hope you have a nice day!
